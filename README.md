# AWS-CodeCommit

Step 1 - Login to your AWS console and search for codecommit.

Step 2 - Now create a repository, by giving some name & description.

```sh
my-app
```

```sh
This is my codecommit repository
```
( ⚠️You are signed in using a root account. You cannot configure SSH connections for a root account, and HTTPS connections for a root account are not recommended. Consider signing in as an IAM user and then setting up your connection.⚠️ )

Step 3 - So we need to create a user and IAM users permissions

```sh
devbabu
```

```sh
AWSCodeCommitPowerUser
```
